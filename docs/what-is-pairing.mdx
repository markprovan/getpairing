# What is Pairing?

Pair Programming, put simply, is two engineers, working on the same problem on the same computer. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently, you can read more on some practical switching techniques [here](/techniques). 

Pairing is a product of the [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) movement.
