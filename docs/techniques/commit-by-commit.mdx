# Commit by Commit

This is a slightly more advanced technique, where we use commits to version control to decide when to switch driver.

1. Implement some small feature in code.
2. Commit
3. Switch

This is a great technique for promoting small, frequent commits but can be a bit more challenging, requiring a bit more experience in pairing from both participants.
