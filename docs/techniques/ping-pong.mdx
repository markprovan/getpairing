# Ping Pong

Ping Pong is a [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) based pairing technique. Here are the steps:

1. Write a new test and run it to see that it fails.
2. Pass control to your pair, who will implement the code required to make the test pass.
3. Implement a new failing test and pass control back.

This technique is great for practicing your TDD skills, building up a great test suite and takes away any doubt about when to switch driver.
