# Pomodoro

The Pomodoro technique is based on the time management tool of the same name. It goes as follows:

1. Set a timer for 25 minutes.
2. Pair until the timer goes off.
3. Take a 5 minute break.
4. Switch roles and repeat.

This is a great technique to follow when getting started. It takes the responsiblity of deciding when to switch away, allowing you to focus purely on pairing. The five minute break is also a great way to build a positive habit. Pairing is an intense practice, so regular breaks are recommended.
