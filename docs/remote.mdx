# Remote Pairing

With the industry moving towards a more distributed workforce, theres been a growing number of engineers who practice remote pair programming. Below is a list of some tools you can make use of to improve your experience.

## Screen Sharing Tools

### Zoom

[Zoom](http://zoom.us) works quite well as a screen sharing tool. You can opt to allow the other person on the call to remote control your machine, making it really easy to pair. Annotations are a bonus.

### Tuple

[Tuple](http://tuple.app) is an application built specifically for remore pair programming. It's designed to be super easy to use and super quick.

## Editor Tools

### Atom Teletype

Github's [Atom](https://atom.io/) ships with Teletype, a feature for remotey sharing your editor window with another Atom user. Teletype uses WebRTC to encrypt all communications.

### Visual Studio Code

Not quite as out the box as Atom, VS Code provides the [Live Share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode#installation) extension, that you'll have to install it yourself. It works the same as Teletype.
